Hi everyone, I am Sachin K Sunny and I use he/his pronouns. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Information Systems Management: Business Intelligence and Data Analytics in Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to this, I have been working as a Market Risk Analyst at Credit Suisse right after graduating with a Bachelor of Technology and Master of Technology degrees from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. Once I graduate from Carnegie Mellon University, I hope to pursue a career in Business Analytics or Data Analytics to draw impactful business decisions from the data generated from product usage.

# What I hope to learn
Since I'll be using the power of data to guide, persuade and convince stakeholders in a project to make business decisions, I want to be able to make them see the impact any such decision would bring through impactful vizualisations. A picture is worth a thousand words and I want to be able to show the right picture and say the right thousand words that go with the picture to be a succesful Business Analyst.
