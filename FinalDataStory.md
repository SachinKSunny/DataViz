6- Median House Prices from Zillow:
Zillow provides the median house prices for a city broken down by zipcode for the current month. This data is available as an API in the following link. I've written a Python script that pulls this data into an easy to use Excel sheet that we'll be using.<br/>

7- Employment Statistics:
The employment statistics for each county in Pittsburgh is pulled from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. This is a good indicator of the economic development of the region and indirectly determines the rise/fall in housing prices over time. The data is directly available as a CSV download in the link below.<br/>

8- Building Permits:
Ease of getting permits in a Zipcode might incentivise certain developers and commerical users to weight this data more in their ranking. It also acts as a good proxy for the economic growth of a region and is an indirect indicator of the GRP of the city. The data is publicly available at the below link.<br/>

9- Crime Data:
Most home owners would like to invest in a low crime neighbourhood. This data will have a high weightage for residential users and small business owners as it determines the potential for further investment and growth of existing investment. The last 30 days data of the crime blotter that's provided by the Police is available publicly at the following link.<br/>

10- School Ratings:
The 2019 School Rankings published by Niche is used to compute the school ratings. Most residential users value this attribute highly while trying to narrow downt their search to a zipcode. The rankings are extracted from the following link:
