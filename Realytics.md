# Project Outline

A brief summary of the Realytics project, what it provides and the rough structure of the story being told is explained in the following sections.

#### Summary

The Realytics project aims at bridging the gaps in the Real Estate Market. Whether you're a potential home owner looking to find the right house, a real estate developer who's looking to invest in the city or a restaurant/small business owner trying to set up shop, we help you find the perfect spot in the town of Pittsburgh. Do not worry, we are not trying to sell you land or a house. We're just trying to help you make an informed decision when you decide to go ahead.

#### Structure

1- Start with how much data is available(Happy user) out there yet we're never able to find what we're looking for when we're looking for it. Maybe the granularity of information isn't to our liking. Or we've to pay for the data. Or we've to spend a lot of time searching and combining data to make a decision. Fatigue from information search leading to something analogus to the Law of Instrument(When all you have is a hammer, everythign looks like a nail). (Starting down the hill of fatigue and sadness)

2- Talk about added risk of large investments and risks coming from various sources. As a home buyer, you'd be concerned with the median house prices and crime in the neighbourhood. As a commercial developer you might be concerned about building permits. As a small business owner you might be concerned about overall economic health of the region and it's people, house prices and permits. But you end up having to spend a lot of time/money as mentioned in Step 1(Low point in search).

3- This is where Realytics comes in(A new hope). Talk about the zipcode wise data we've collected so far and how we've catered the data to fit your investment needs. More weightage to home prices for home owners; more weightage to permits for commercial developers.

4- Show the visualizations superimposed over a map of Pittsburgh in a diverging colour scheme to draw user Attention. Also show the top priorities for each user visualized for the user's top 3 Zipcodes. A succint summary of the values of the attributes may also be provided.
(Peak of happiness for the user at the solution to an important problem). A much more detailed explanation on how the ranking was computed can be added in this section too.

5- Call to action would be access to the whole dataset(which is publicly available) so that the user can get more information that's catered to his exact needs.
