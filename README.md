Hi everyone, I am Sachin K Sunny and I use he/his pronouns. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Information Systems Management: Business Intelligence and Data Analytics in Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to this, I have been working as a Market Risk Analyst at Credit Suisse right after graduating with a Bachelor of Technology and Master of Technology degrees from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. Once I graduate from Carnegie Mellon University, I hope to pursue a career in Business Analytics or Data Analytics to draw impactful business decisions from the data generated from product usage.
